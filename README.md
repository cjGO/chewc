## How to use

``` python
import jax
import jax.numpy as jnp
import time

# --- 1. JAX Setup ---
key = jax.random.PRNGKey(42)

# --- 2. Imports from the 'chewc' library ---
from chewc.sp import SimParam
from chewc.population import Population, msprime_pop # Use msprime_pop
from chewc.trait import add_trait_a
# Import the generation runner

# --- 3. Define Genome and Founder Population Blueprint ---
# Parameters for the msprime simulation
n_chr, n_loci_per_chr, ploidy = 3, 100, 2
n_founder_ind = 100

# --- 4. Define Trait Architecture ---
trait_mean = 0.0
trait_var = 1.0
trait_h2 = 0.05

# --- 5. Define Burn-in Parameters ---
n_parents_select = 10
n_progeny = 100
burn_in_generations = 20
